The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions. 
Python executes code following the try statement as a “normal” part of the program. 
The code that follows the except statement is the program's response to any exceptions in the preceding try clause.

"""When try-except scenario is not required?"""
1- when we don't care about exception handling much more we don't this try-except
2- when our program are too small we don't want to use this
